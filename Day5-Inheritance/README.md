# Day 5: Inheritance

## Problem

### Objective

<p>In this challenge, we practice implementing inheritance and use JavaScript prototypes to add a new method to an existing prototype. Check out the attached Classes tutorial to refresh what we've learned about these topics.</p>

### Task

<p>We provide the implementation for a Rectangle class in the editor. Perform the following tasks:</p>

1. Add an area method to Rectangle's prototype.
2. Create a Square class that satisfies the following:

   - It is a subclass of Rectangle.
   - It contains a constructor and no other methods.
   - It can use the Rectangle class' area method to print the area of a Square object.

<p>Locked code in the editor tests the class and method implementations and prints the area values to STDOUT.</p>
